# About Me
Hi, my name is Jos√© Maria. I'm 26 years old and live in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

Currently, I'm graduating in Math at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and searching for new opportunities to work with data analysis or data science.

# Projects

To study, practice, and apply my bits of knowledge, I have worked on some personal projects.

## COVID-19: A Global Visualization (Power BI)

https://github.com/josepaulajr/COVID-19_Analisys

This project combines two data sources and two reports to see how Covid-19 evolved in the world. The project afforded me to practice several data processes like ETL, Wrangling, Analysis, and Visualization. Besides many Power BI tools and concepts: Merge Queries, Time intelligence functions, Filter Context Measures, Row Context Measures, etc.   

## My Finances (Excel)

https://github.com/josepaulajr/My_Finances

Using Excel, I created a complete system to manage personal finances. In this project, I used some theoretical topics like relational databases models and data visualization, as well as a series of Excel features: Power Query, Power Pivot, Data Model, VBA, User Form, Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, etc.

## Focus (Google Sheets)

With Google Sheets and Apps Scripts, I made a spreadsheet to register and analyze studies topics and time. The experience using this will be better if you are familiar with the Pomodoro technique.
