# About Me
Hi, my name is Jos√© Maria. I'm 26 years old and live in Belo Horizonte, Brazil.

Currently, I'm graduating in Math at the Federal University of Minas Gerais and working with quantitative analysis.

# Projects

To study, practice, and apply my bits of knowledge, I have been worked on some personal projects.

## Brazillian E-Commerce: States and Freights Analyses (Python)

https://github.com/josepaulajr/Brazillian_E-Commerce

Through Data Visualization using NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, that notebook explores the Brazillian E-Commerce with Python. The project continues in development and, soon, I intend to found the best regression model to predict a freight.

## COVID-19: A Global View (Power BI)

https://github.com/josepaulajr/COVID-19_A_Global_View

This project combines two data sources and two reports to see how Covid-19 evolved in the world. The project afforded me to practice several data processes like ETL, Wrangling, Analysis, and Visualization. Besides many Power BI tools and concepts: Merge Queries, Time intelligence functions, Filter Context Measures, Row Context Measures, etc.   

## My Finances (Excel)

https://github.com/josepaulajr/My_Finances

Using Excel, I created a complete system to manage personal finances. In this project, I used some theoretical topics like relational databases models and data visualization, as well as a series of Excel features: Power Query, Power Pivot, Data Model, VBA, User Form, Pivot Table, Pivot Chart, etc.

## Focus (Google Sheets)

With Google Sheets and Apps Scripts, I made a spreadsheet to register and analyze studies topics and time. The experience using this will be better if you are familiar with the Pomodoro technique.
